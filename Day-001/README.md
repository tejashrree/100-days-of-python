# 🎸 Band Name Generator

This is my first Python project from [Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). It's a simple and fun console-based app that generates a random band name based on user input.

## 💡 Project Description

The Band Name Generator asks the user for two pieces of information:

- The name of the city they grew up in
- The name of their pet

Then it combines the two to create a unique and funny band name suggestion.

> Example Output:
> ```
> Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
> What's the name of the city you grew up in? --> Delhi
> What's your pet's name? --> Bruno
> Your band name could be: Delhi Bruno
> ```
